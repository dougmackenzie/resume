I probably didn't need to use React for such a simple website, but I wanted the source code to show some insight on my coding. Plus it's just nice to work with.

A UI/CSS library hasn't been used because:

- I wanted the site to reflect my style and show a bit of my CSS code.
- A site of this size probably doesn't need one.

## Progressive enhancements

At this point the site is quite basic, but I've built it in a way that I can progressively enhance.

Here are the things that I'd like to do next (in priority order):

- [ ] Add links to my Social accounts from the intro screen- LinkedIn, StackOverflow, GitHub, etc.
- [ ] Add an absolute positioned element that provides a link to the source code on GitHub.
- [ ] Add ability to click into job history cards to see more information about projects, achievements, etc.
- [ ] Add an image slider to the About section that shows more of my personality and the things I love.
- [ ] Experiment with some more styling on the intro screen- border, downwards arrow, container for the text.
- [ ] Add some animations to the site to make it a bit more interesting.
